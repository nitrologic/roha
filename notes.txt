specific modifications or areas in `roha.js` you'd like me to review or

Hey Simon, I'm glad to take a look at the lines from your `roha` client test.
Please go ahead and share the specific lines or sections you're concerned about
regarding the token usage spike to 14K. I'll help analyze and suggest ways to
optimize if needed.
